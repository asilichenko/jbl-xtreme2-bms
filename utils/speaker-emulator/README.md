The commands sent are standard commands for the gas gauging device BQ28Z610:
- 12.1.4 0x06/07 Temperature()
- 12.1.5 0x08/09 Voltage()
- 12.1.23 0x2C/2D RelativeStateOfCharge()

Commands Voltage() and RelativeStateOfCharge() are sent in pair once per 5 seconds.

Command Temperature() is sent ones per 10s.

There is can be any time shift between them.
