# JBL XTREME 2 BMS
Arduino sketches to analyse and emulate BMS microchip of the Battery Pack for the JBL XTREME 2 Bluetooth Speaker.

## Module 1. Stub for Battery Pack

This program is designed to be written on Arduino or ATtiny85 and acts as a stub to respond to the speaker's requests via the I2C protocol, enabling the speaker to be used while connected to mains power without using a battery.

It can be used when you don't want to or cannot use the battery pack.

### Address of the battery device

To find out the I2C address of the battery gas gauging device you may use the sketch from the examples:

### Commands receiver

You may use this program to log commands from the speaker.

### Speaker emulator

This util periodically sends commands to the battery pack gas gauging device as the real speaker does.
