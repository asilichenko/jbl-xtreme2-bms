# JBL XTREME 2 BMS
Arduino scetches to analyse and emulate BMS microchip of the JBL XTREME 2 Bluetooth Speaker Battery.

## Module 1. Stub for Battery Pack

This program is designed to be written on Arduino or ATtiny85 and acts as a stub to respond to the speaker's requests via the I2C protocol, enabling the speaker to be used while connected to mains power without using a battery.

It can be used when you don't want to or cannot use the battery pack.
