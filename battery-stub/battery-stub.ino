  @brief This is Battery Stub for JBL XTREAME 2 on Arduino.

  This stub can be used when you don't want to or cannot use the battery pack.

  Write it on Arduino or ATtiny, connect it to the JBL speaker,
  and now the speaker can work mains-powered without the battery.

  Important: The stub should have its own power supply, at least a supercapacitor,
  because the JBL speaker doesn't supply power until it receives the correct response
  to the I2C commands.

  @warning [!] When you use this stub, the real battery should not be connected to the speaker,
  because the stub does not track the state of the battery; it just responds with hardcoded values.

  @see Texas Instruments Technical Reference Manual https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/sluua65e/sluua65e.pdf
  @see BQ28Z610 product: https://www.ti.com/product/BQ28Z610

  Connections

  Arduino Nano:
  - A4 = SDA -> white
  - A5 = SCL -> yellow

   AtTiny85:
   - 5 = SDA -> white
   - 7 = SCL -> yellow

  <pre>
      -|1* 8|- VCC
      -|2  7|- C (SCL, yellow)
      -|3  6|-
  GND -|4  5|- D (SDA, white)
